How do I approach designing software?
This project has made me a lot more adept at visual studio as well as giving me a rudimentary knowledge of 3D object manipulation in the program. The skill of 3D visualization was a major part of this class and final project and i feel that skill can be useful in a lot of future work.
How do I approach developing programs?
I learned a lot of new systems and strategies some which slowed me down but other that greatly sped up my work flow. I applied all these new techniques to finish my final project. Iteration was a huge factor in this project with the weekly milestones all leading up to the culmination of the final project. Each weak taught a new skill that was finally combined in the 7th module for completion. My code development has become a lot more organized I feel through the course of this project. A visual representation of the actions of my code lead me to try to segment important parts together to aid in faster alterations.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
As i said before the skill of 3D visualization is a endlessly useful skill and can be applied in a multitude of situations and problems. This skill as well as the ability to work in a 3D virtual space will no doubt come in handy in future endeavors as well as the strengthening of my general coding skills.
